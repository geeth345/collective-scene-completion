# grid-environment

Experimenting with PettingZoo, eventual goal is to further explore the use of generative models for collective perception in multi-agent systems. 

Currently, I am working on building an environment to represent MNIST images. The idea is that a "swarm" of agents will be able to move around the pixel grid (with limited individual vision) and collectively percieve the digit.
